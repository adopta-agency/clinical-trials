<p>While the original ClinicalTrials.gov data was broken down into separate machine readable files, it was pipe delimited, which isn't always the breakfast of data champions, so I wanted to make sure it was also available in JSON format to encourage as much reuse as possible, across many different audiences.</p>
<p>With the clinical trials data in a MysQL database, it was very easy to write a script that would output as separate JSON Files:</p>

<p>The script could use some tweaking, and I haven't certified all the data outputted yet, but it has helped me quickly generate a complete set of clinical trial data in JSON for anyone to download and use all, or part of.</p>
